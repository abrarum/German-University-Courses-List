The general admission requirements can be found here.","English language skills at B2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: ALTE (Level 3), UNIcert® II, Cambridge English (First/FCE), TOEFL (min. 72), IELTS (5.0 or better), PTE Academic (min. 59) or TOEIC (min. 785)
German level A2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (This is required upon entering the study programme! This means you can apply without proof of A2 level knowledge of German, but you must provide it before the first day of your first semester.)
Why is this required? A special feature of the programme is that non-native German speaking students will acquire sufficient language skills in German to be able to enter the German labour market at the beginning of the practical study semester and be able to complete the third study section partly in German with an appropriate choice of specialisation modules.","The programme integrates practical applications in our laboratories, state-of-the-art machinery and equipment (e.g. collaborative robotics, driverless transportation system, VR, etc.) and most commonly used programming languages and software (e.g. customised SAP ERP system, BI) in as many courses as possible. An extensive digital library is available. Moodle serves as a learning platform. Access to all aspects mentioned is free of charge to students."
